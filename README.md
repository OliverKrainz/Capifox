# Capifox
Access ISDN from FoxPro

Capifox is a solution to transfer data between two remote FoxPro programs by using ISDN. All source files contain many (german) comments 
explaining code and dataflow.
Back in the day the C source files were compiled with Turbo C++. The FoxPro source files are based on FoxPro 2.5 but should run on any FoxPro version.
